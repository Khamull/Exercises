In C#, overriding refers to the process of redefining a method in a subclass (derived class) with the same name and type signature as a method in its superclass (base class). This allows the subclass to provide a specific implementation of the method that differs from the implementation in the superclass.

Key points about method overriding in C#:

Method Signature: The overridden method in the subclass must have the exact same signature (name, return type, and parameters) as the method in the superclass.

Keyword Usage: To override a method, you use the override keyword in the method declaration in the subclass.

Inheritance Requirement: Method overriding is possible only when there is a base class (superclass) and a derived class (subclass) relationship.

Virtual Methods: The method in the superclass must be declared using the virtual keyword to allow it to be overridden. If a method is not marked as virtual, it cannot be overridden in subclasses.

Here's a simple example to illustrate method overriding in C#:

csharp
Copy code
// Base class
class Animal
{
    public virtual void MakeSound()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Animal makes a sound");
    }
}

// Derived class
class Dog : Animal
{
    public override void MakeSound()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Dog barks");
    }
}

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        Animal animal = new Animal();
        animal.MakeSound();  // Output: "Animal makes a sound"

        Dog dog = new Dog();
        dog.MakeSound();     // Output: "Dog barks"

        Animal animal2 = new Dog();
        animal2.MakeSound(); // Output: "Dog barks" (even when referred to as Animal)
    }
}
In this example:

The Animal class has a virtual method MakeSound() which can be overridden.
The Dog class overrides MakeSound() to provide a specific behavior (barking).
When an instance of Dog is created, calling MakeSound() on it executes the overridden method from Dog.
Even when an instance of Dog is referred to as an Animal, the overridden method in Dog is still called due to polymorphism.
Method overriding is fundamental to achieving polymorphic behavior in object-oriented programming
