For C# garbage collectors, which statement is not true?

Freeing Memory on the stack
Avoiding Memory Leaks
Freeing Memory Occupied by unreferenced objects
Closing unclosed database connections/Collections, needs to reasearch
Closing Unclosed Files

Freeing Memory on the stack - False. Garbage collectors do not manage memory on the stack; they deal with memory on the managed heap.

Avoiding Memory Leaks - True. Garbage collectors help in avoiding memory leaks by reclaiming memory occupied by unreferenced objects.

Freeing Memory Occupied by unreferenced objects - True. This is a primary function of garbage collectors in C#. They reclaim memory from objects that are no longer reachable.

Closing unclosed database connections - False. Garbage collectors do not manage database connections. It's the programmer's responsibility to manage and close connections properly.

Closing Unclosed Files - False. Garbage collectors do not manage file resources. Proper file handling includes closing files explicitly when they are no longer needed.

Therefore, the combinations are:

Statement 1: False (Freeing Memory on the stack)
Statement 2: True (Avoiding Memory Leaks)
Statement 3: True (Freeing Memory Occupied by unreferenced objects)
Statement 4: False (Closing unclosed database connections)
Statement 5: False (Closing Unclosed Files)
